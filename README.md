Remember: Deliberate practice does not mean looking for answers and
memorizing it. You won't go very far with that approach. The more you
are able to solve a problem yourself without any reference to answers,
the more you will improve.

记住：刻意练习并不意味着寻找答案并记住它，这种练习方法不是长久之计。
在没有参考答案情况下，越能自主解决问题，才越能提高自身能力。
